- Project goal - Optimize a login webpage in the semester of Spring 2020.
- Code was accessed using a Ruby on Rails framework.
- Contributions 
  - Fixing a bug with the login page onLoad, where a white screen would load in first that had to be clicked through.
    - Fixed first with an autoclick, then enhanced with a millisecond timer halting the load, so the page appeared to load naturally. 
- Other aspects of the page were fixed by other members of the team.
